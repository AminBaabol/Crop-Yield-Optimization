# Crop-Yield-Optimization
 Maximizing crop production through field data analysis
 
Overview
We will continue the analysis started with the midterm project. We will use the three data sets from the
midterm and two additional data sets for the years 2013 and 2018. We will divide each data set into grid
cells, then compute a yield estimate for each cell. We will then merge the data by grid cell and compute a
normalized yield estimate and standard deviation for each cell across years. We will use these estimates to
classify cells as having High, Average or Low yields, and as having Stable, Average or Unstable yields.
